I am learning jenkins pipeline with github webhook, i am using this project for my testing

# Hello Node
This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node.

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.
